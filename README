This library is used to divide a sequence of objects into a sequence
of subsequences of those objects, such that the result is optimal
according to a cost function supplied by client code.

The main use for this library so far has been in an editor for music
scores where it serves the purpose of dividing a sequence of measures
into a sequence of lines, where each line contains one or more
measures.

A related use case would be to divide the words of a paragraph of text
into lines, where each line contains one or more words.
